Implementation steps:

1.Use created RG - ChonoResGroup over which I have write and read rights since I use company subscription.
2.Created ACR
3.Creted AKS
4.Created sql server and sql db
5.Copied and created connection string in docker/index.php
6.Use azure acr cli to build and push image to ACR:

 az acr build --registry chonorgexamacr --image chonochonov/azurergexam:v3 . 

7.Set the image name in k8s manifest file
8.get and store the credentials needed for communication with the cluster, you must execute:

  az aks get-credentials --resource-group ChonoResGroup --name azurergexamaks

9.Now, you can use the kubectl tool to manage the cluster. Test that it is working:

   kubectl cluster-info

10.Navigate to directory where manifest files are and Deploy both the service and application simultaneously:

   kubectl apply -f service.yaml -f deployment.yaml

11.Check:

   kubectl get svc,pod

12.Get the load balancer IP address and test the application
13.Create Web App
14.Copy the connection string used earlier to the /webapp/index.php file 
   Save and close the file

15.Copy the application URL and paste it into a browser tab
16.The application working
17.Function App + Timer Trigger every 3 minutes
18.Change C# conn string with appropriate and after save hit refresh button as well
    Don’t forget to change the values of the database name, server, and the password
19.Working

20.Function App - Http Trigger

  a) check the function logic and change connection string 

     Don’t forget to change the values of the database name, server, and the password

     Click Save

21.Use function url to trigger http request

22.Organizational apply a tag role with value of front on the web app
23.Organizational apply a tag role with value of back on the database
24.Put a resource lock of type Delete on the database
25.Define (if needed) and assign a policy that enforces tag
26.Tag policy working on new function app
27.Prove that the policy is working by adding a resource of your choice with name POLICY (this can be
   anything, for example a virtual network,
